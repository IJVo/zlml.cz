Installing
----------
The best way to install this project is to download latest package with dependencies using Composer:

1. Install Composer: (see http://getcomposer.org/)
2. Use Composer:

		composer create-project mrtnzlml/zlml.cz --stability=dev

3. Install Bower: (see http://bower.io/)
4. Go to the project folder and install client side dependencies:

		bower install

It's like Composer for front-end.

Make directories `temp`, `log`, `www/webtemp`, `www/chunks` and `www/uploads` writable.
Navigate your browser to the `www` directory and you will see a welcome page.
PHP 5.4 allows you run `php -S localhost:8888 -t www` to start the webserver and
then visit `http://localhost:8888` in your browser.
Port must be set according to the local computer settings.

It is CRITICAL that file `app/config/config.neon` & whole `app`, `log`
and `temp` directory are NOT accessible directly via a web browser! If you
don't protect this directory from direct web access, anybody will be able to see
your sensitive data. See [security warning](http://nette.org/security-warning).

Then you have to create database for this website. You can use Adminer tool in
`http://localhost:8888/adminer` or you can do that manually using command line:

		mysql -u root -e 'create database zlml;'
        mysql -u root -D zlml < sql/zlml.sql
        
There is also automatic (beta) installer. Just install this project using Composer and open
it in your favourite browser. I am still working on it...
